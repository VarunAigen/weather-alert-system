## ✨ **Alternative: Use URLs (No Download)**

If you prefer, I can update the component to use CDN URLs instead of local files. This way you don't need to download anything!

**Pros:**
- No downloads needed
- Smaller app size
- Easy updates

**Cons:**
- Requires internet connection
- Slightly slower first load

Let me know if you want to use URLs instead!
